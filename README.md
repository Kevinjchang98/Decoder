## Development setup

### Compiling and Building the Project

This project uses [MinGW64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) and [CMake 3.25 or later](https://cmake.org/)

### [Qt6](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6)

You'll need to have [Qt6 version 6.2.4](https://www.qt.io/product/qt6) installed. It should be at `C:\Qt` so
the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` for mingw64 is `C:\Qt\6.2.4\mingw64`
